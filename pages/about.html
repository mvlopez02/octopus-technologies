               <h2><u>Background</u></h2> 
               <p>Throughout history, humanity has sought various ways to measure and understand energy consumption. From the earliest rudimentary measuring devices to modern technological advancements, the interest in quantifying consumed energy has remained constant. The evolution of power meters has been influenced by several factors, including the development of electromagnetic theory, the growing demand for precision in measuring electrical energy, and the need to monitor and manage energy consumption efficiently.The first attempts at measuring electrical energy date back to the 19th century, with the invention of primitive devices that recorded electrical current consumption. These early meters, though basic, laid the foundation for the development of more advanced technologies in the future. As electricity became more widely available and used in the 20th century, the demand for more accurate and reliable power meters increased significantly.</p>

                <h2><u>State of the art</u></h2> 
                <p>With the advent of modern electronics and computing, power meters have undergone a radical transformation. Advances in semiconductor technology, sensors, and data processing have enabled the development of highly sophisticated and accurate power meters, capable of measuring a wide range of electrical parameters with great precision and in real time. These advancements have led to greater energy management efficiency and have allowed users to monitor and control their energy consumption more effectively than ever before. Among the most notable techniques are the use of shunt resistors to accurately measure high-intensity currents, the Hall effect for measuring currents and magnetic fields, and the piezoelectric effect for voltage measurement. These techniques, combined with signal processing algorithms and digital communication capabilities, have led to the creation of advanced power meters that are essential in industrial, commercial, and residential applications for efficient and sustainable energy management.</p>
